If you had lived in Europe during the Middle Ages, the idea that the earth changes would have seemed crazy. At that time, people believed that mountains, valleys, and other landscape features had always been there. True, rare natural catastrophes sometimes occurred. Earthquakes, for example, shook the ground and triggered landslides. In some places, volcanoes erupted and sent up fountains of lava, or red-hot melted rock. However, people viewed these catastrophes as punishments from God, not as the earth changing.

During the 1400s, 1500s, and 1600s, European explorers found new continents and islands. Mapmakers created the first relatively accurate maps of the entire world. When people studied these maps, they noticed something interesting. Several continents looked as if they might fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. 

Take a look at a world map or globe. See how the eastern edge of South America looks as if it fits into the western edge of Africa? People wondered if the continents had once been joined and later moved apart.

During the 1700s and 1800s, scientists noticed how great masses of rock appeared to have been lifted up to form cliffs and mountains over time. They began to believe that once-tall mountains had been worn down by wind, rain, and ice and that, over thousands of years, valleys had been carved by rivers. 

These scientists found evidence that sea levels had been higher and lower in the past. They found layers of rock on mountain peaks that contained fossils, the preserved remains of things that lived long ago.

Geology is the study of the makeup of the earth and the forces and processes that shape and change it. Rocks are very important in geology because they hold clues to how Earth's surface has changed over time. Together with fossils, rocks provide information about the history of the earth.
